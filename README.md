# Mobile Applications Ontology

An ontology on the domain of grand Mobile Applications. Mobile applications are a striking example of developing a complex ontology and capturing the links between their modeling. I have chosen this domain because, currently, information on it is very scarce and fragmented. The purpose of the ontology is to provide an overview of the modeling and classification of mobile applications, along with some concrete examples. The project was developed from scratch using protégé and, in addition, several queries (SPARQL and DL) were also written to prove the effective functioning of the whole project.
